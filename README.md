LaraChipmunk
============

Send mail with attachments form a directory

This project is developed with Intellij IDEA 13 - Community Edition.

The main class is `app.App`. To build the project (waiting for cli Ant scripts),
use the *Build > Build Artifacts* menu of Intellij. This will create a directory
`out/artifacts/LaraChipmunk` which contains a JAR and the HTML files for
deployment (to change artifact build options, go to *File > Project Structure*,
then there's a *Artifacts* section.

See `doc/INSTALL.txt` for how to deploy and launch the application without an IDE
